Welcome to my UPGRADED book repository!!
.
.
This is a side project that I created in order to improve my skills at OOP, API requests and data manipulation (getting, choosing, editing, appending and saving data from an app).
.
.
Next steps:
-> Create a new file for common tkinter functions (there's redundancy between main and search)
-> Update search boxlist instead of closing the window
-> Cancel Button on append, edit and search
-> Login (user and password) with a file for each user and a global catalog
-> search book price (get book price and link)
