Welcome to my UPGRADED book repository!!
.
.
This is a side project that I created in order to improve my skills at OOP, API requests and data manipulation (getting, choosing, editing, appending and saving data from an app).
.
.
New functions:
-> Gets info from Open Library API (using requests and bs4 modules)
-> Has a search option (by category and gets results by one of the words or initial word letter. very fancy)

<<<<<<< HEAD
Next steps:
-> Create a new file for common tkinter functions (there's redundancy between main and search)
-> Update search boxlist instead of closing the window
=======
Run the main.py to start the code
