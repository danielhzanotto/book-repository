Welcome to my UPGRADED book repository!!

This is a side project that I created in order to improve my skills at OOP and data manipulation (getting, picking, editing, appending and saving data from an app).

You need to have installed the pandas and tkinter modules in order to run this code.
.
.
Run the main.py to start the code

New functions:
-> Gets info from Open Library API (using requests and bs4 modules)
-> Has a search option (by category and gets results by one of the words or initial word letter. very fancy)

Next steps:
-> Create a new file for common tkinter functions (there's redundancy between main and search)
-> Update search boxlist instead of closing the window
